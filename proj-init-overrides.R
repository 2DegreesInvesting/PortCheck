### This file can be used to "override" any of the constants
### defined in either 2dii-init.R or a project specific init
### file such as PortCheck-init.R.

### In general best to keep to standard directory structure
### but if needed can use this file.

### This file is specific to each developer and should not be
### checked into GitHub
### After I checked it into gitHub I included it in the .gitignore 
### file so once you clone it you will not see it in GitHub Desktop

### example: PROJ.CODE.PATH <- "C:/SomeOtherPath/toSomeCode/"
